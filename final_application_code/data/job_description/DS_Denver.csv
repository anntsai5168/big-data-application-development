You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the \'why\' behind what you are doing.\nYou have a strong sense of data intuition.

We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.\n\nDo you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust- based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?\n\nCome and see why Fortune Magazine recently named The Trade Desk among the best small to medium-sized workplaces in the US.\n\nAbout The Role\nOur Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in most aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.\nOur Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages, graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data, and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.\nData Scientists contribute to more than our product \xe2\x80\x93 they build up our team.

You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the \'why\' behind what you are doing.\nYou have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don\'t work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.\nYou are a broadly skilled data scientist who may have experience working with embedded models in always-on production systems and may have worked across a variety of technologies and data sources.\nYou have a product-focused mindset.

You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.\nYou value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.\nYou are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don\'t need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.\nWhat You Bring To The Table\nYou have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.\nYou are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.\nYou are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.\nYou have up to 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role.

We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.\n\nDo you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust- based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?\n\nCome and see why Fortune Magazine recently named The Trade Desk among the best small to medium-sized workplaces in the US.\n\nAbout The Role\nOur Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in most aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.\nOur Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages, graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data, and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.\nData Scientists contribute to more than our product \xe2\x80\x93 they build up our team.

You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the \'why\' behind what you are doing.\nYou have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don\'t work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.\nYou are a broadly skilled data scientist who may have experience working with embedded models in always-on production systems and may have worked across a variety of technologies and data sources.\nYou have a product-focused mindset.

You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.\nYou value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.\nYou are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don\'t need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.\nWhat You Bring To The Table\nYou have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.\nYou are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.\nYou are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.\nYou have up to 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role. Some of those years of experience may have been spent pursuing an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what\xe2\x80\x99s most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.\nYou have some experience with big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, are able to write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start.

We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.\n\nDo you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust- based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?\n\nCome and see why Fortune Magazine recently named The Trade Desk among the best small to medium-sized workplaces in the US.\n\nAbout The Role\nOur Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in most aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.\nOur Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages, graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data, and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.\nData Scientists contribute to more than our product \xe2\x80\x93 they build up our team. We are a team built on a foundation of generosity and openness, and we expect our data scientists to help make others better and raise the bar for those around them.\nWho We Are Looking For\nYou have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the \'why\' behind what you are doing.\nYou have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don\'t work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.\nYou are a broadly skilled data scientist who may have experience working with embedded models in always-on production systems and may have worked across a variety of technologies and data sources.\nYou have a product-focused mindset.

Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.\nYou value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.\nYou are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don\'t need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.\nWhat You Bring To The Table\nYou have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.\nYou are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.\nYou are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.\nYou have up to 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role. Some of those years of experience may have been spent pursuing an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what\xe2\x80\x99s most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.\nYou have some experience with big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, are able to write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start.

b'Data Scientist',b'The Trade Desk',"b'Boulder, CO, US'","b'The Trade Desk is a global technology company with a mission to create a better Internet for everyone through principled, intelligent advertising. We help the world\'s biggest brands reach consumers, and our platform funds content providers and publishers who keep the global Internet free and open for everyone.\n\nHandling over 600 billion queries per day (more than 100X the query volume of search globally), our platform operates at unprecedented scale and generates massive amounts of data. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.\n\nDo you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust- based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?\n\nCome and see why Fortune Magazine recently named The Trade Desk among the best small to medium-sized workplaces in the US.\n\nAbout The Role\nOur Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in most aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.\nOur Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages, graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data, and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.\nData Scientists contribute to more than our product \xe2\x80\x93 they build up our team. We are a team built on a foundation of generosity and openness, and we expect our data scientists to help make others better and raise the bar for those around them.\nWho We Are Looking For\nYou have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the \'why\' behind what you are doing.\nYou have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don\'t work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.\nYou are a broadly skilled data scientist who may have experience working with embedded models in always-on production systems and may have worked across a variety of technologies and data sources.\nYou have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.\nYou work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.\nYou value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.\nYou are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don\'t need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.\nWhat You Bring To The Table\nYou have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.\nYou are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.\nYou are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.\nYou have up to 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role. Some of those years of experience may have been spent pursuing an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what\xe2\x80\x99s most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.\nYou have some experience with big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, are able to write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.\nThe Trade Desk does not accept unsolicited resumes from search firm recruiters. Fees will not be paid in the event a candidate submitted by a recruiter without an agreement in place is hired; such resumes will be deemed the sole property of The Trade Desk. The Trade Desk is an equal opportunity employer. All aspects of employment will be based on merit, competence, performance, and business needs. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, marital status, age, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, pregnancy, genetic information, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, veteran status, or any other status protected under federal, state, or local law.'"

You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the \'why\' behind what you are doing.\nYou have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don\'t work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.\nYou are a broadly skilled data scientist who may have experience working with embedded models in always-on production systems and may have worked across a variety of technologies and data sources.\nYou have a product-focused mindset.

What and how you can contribute is what\xe2\x80\x99s most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.\nYou have some experience with big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, are able to write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start.

We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.\n\nDo you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust- based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?\n\nCome and see why Fortune Magazine recently named The Trade Desk among the best small to medium-sized workplaces in the US.\n\nAbout The Role\nOur Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in most aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.\nOur Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages, graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data, and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.\nData Scientists contribute to more than our product \xe2\x80\x93 they build up our team.

You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the \'why\' behind what you are doing.\nYou have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don\'t work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.\nYou are a broadly skilled data scientist who may have experience working with embedded models in always-on production systems and may have worked across a variety of technologies and data sources.\nYou have a product-focused mindset.

What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don\'t need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.\nWhat You Bring To The Table\nYou have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.\nYou are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.\nYou are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.\nYou have up to 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role.
