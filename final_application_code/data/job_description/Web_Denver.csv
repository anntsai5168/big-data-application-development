We're committed as a team to teaching and sharing with each other in order to succeed.\n\nWe don't normally put the level we're looking for into our job descriptions, but our team has a specific need for a developer or two who has experience maintaining and upgrading complex JavaScript applications.\n\nWhat The Team Looks Like\n\nYou'd be joining a team of about 25 developers, grouped into roughly 5 person squads. We represent a wide range of experience and interests. But we all agree to do three things well:\nWe strive to build a strong team that allows us to do and learn more than we could as individuals. Being inclusive is important to our long term success.\nOur goal is for Twitter to be one of the world's most performant web apps/PWAs. Speed is a crucial feature for everyone, and we measure our success by the performance of our application.\nWe collaborate to create a codebase that will be a joy to work in for years to come.

Your skill and enthusiasm will be appreciated and rewarded here.\n\nWhat You'll Do\n\nWe want you to find work that aligns with both the career goals you establish with your manager and the goals Twitter has for twitter.com . But, to be more specific, the kind of things we'd like you to do:\nGet to know your peer developers to understand their challenges in day to day work so that you can move quickly and with empathy to improve all aspects of their work.\nWork with Twitter's infrastructure to ensure that our Node server is running efficiently, and explore opportunities for using the server in new ways (e.g what would it look like for us to support a server rendered tweet?)\nThis job is more than JavaScript. Your non-coding skills (Communication, Mentoring, Project Management, etc) are very important. We believe that leadership comes from everywhere, and it's important that our Senior Developers have the skills to lead complex projects successfully within a large organization.\n\nWhat Skills Will Make You Successful\nYou're passionate about teaching: We put a high value on learning from each other. You should be skilled at paring and teaching things that you've learned.\nYou've got empathy and self-awareness: The foundational trust of all strong teams relies on understanding yourself and others.\nYou care about web accessibility: we want to reach everyone everywhere.\nYou're fluent with modern JavaScript: Twitter.com is a React/Redux app served by Node.js with the standard tooling (Webpack, Babel, ES6, Linting, JS Typing, Prettier, etc).
