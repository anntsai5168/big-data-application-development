We have high expectations of our engineers, and we want to make sure they are rewarded for meeting them. Our benefits package is great (including fantastic health insurance), and we offer unlimited paid-time-off. We offer stock options to share in the success of the business. And of course, we have the typical startup on-site goodies like snacks, beer, and even a cold-brew coffee tap.\nModern technology with quality - We try to stay ahead of the technology curve, while being pragmatic about production readiness and community support. We care deeply about developer happiness, productivity, and experience .We are heavily investing in Elixir, an amazing functional language built on top of Erlang and the BEAM VM. We are also heavily investing in Typescript, a flexibly typed language that\'s fully interoperable with JavaScript.

We believe information is critical for our team to succeed, and we build tools to democratize data and support an open and honest environment.

Instead we spin up teams around a focused project, with clear goals and deliverable outputs. These teams give engineers the ability to dive deep on a given feature, or jump into a project where they have less technical or domain expertise.\n\nwNRmDhw7le'"

We are partnering with one of the biggest players in the automotive space to provide a SaaS-like vehicle transactions platform. If building a modern and high-volume SaaS platform sounds interesting, join us!\n\nWhat You\'ll Be Doing\nWorking on small, autonomous, results-oriented project teams to deliver high-value software.\nBuilding backend features and functionality with Elixir and Phoenix.\nBuilding user interfaces for end users and platform administrators with Typescript and React.\nOperating with and iterating on our cloud infrastructure from CI/CD to monitoring and metrics.\n\nWhat We\'re Looking For\nA love of learning and growing technical breadth and depth.\nMid-level experience with any mainstream programming languages, with a passion for modern but pragmatic code.\nIndividuals looking for a high performing team, where we support each other while holding ourselves and each other accountable.\n\nBonus Points\nExperience with Phoenix/Elixir.\nExperience with React/TypeScript.\nExperience with Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker, or other modern DevOps tools.\nExperience with building multi-tenant, best-practices SaaS products.\n\nAbout Blinker Engineering\nOur Engineering Team Core Values\nEngineering @ Blinker\n\nWhy Blinker?\nHighly competitive benefits - We regularly review our compensation brackets to make sure they are highly competitive with the top 30% of the Denver market. We have high expectations of our engineers, and we want to make sure they are rewarded for meeting them. Our benefits package is great (including fantastic health insurance), and we offer unlimited paid-time-off. We offer stock options to share in the success of the business. And of course, we have the typical startup on-site goodies like snacks, beer, and even a cold-brew coffee tap.\nModern technology with quality - We try to stay ahead of the technology curve, while being pragmatic about production readiness and community support. We care deeply about developer happiness, productivity, and experience .We are heavily investing in Elixir, an amazing functional language built on top of Erlang and the BEAM VM. We are also heavily investing in Typescript, a flexibly typed language that\'s fully interoperable with JavaScript.

We limit meetings, favoring ad-hoc and proactive communication. We care deeply about the team ""vibe"" and ensure we have an inclusive, fun, and engaging environment for everyone. We believe information is critical for our team to succeed, and we build tools to democratize data and support an open and honest environment. In our autonomous workplace, engineers make important decisions everyday and must feel they have the right amount of information to make those decisions - which is why we favor transparency.\nOpportunities to specialize and generalize - We don\'t have fixed teams at Blinker. Instead we spin up teams around a focused project, with clear goals and deliverable outputs. These teams give engineers the ability to dive deep on a given feature, or jump into a project where they have less technical or domain expertise.\n\nwNRmDhw7le'"

Our benefits package is great (including fantastic health insurance), and we offer unlimited paid-time-off. We offer stock options to share in the success of the business.

We have high expectations of our engineers, and we want to make sure they are rewarded for meeting them. Our benefits package is great (including fantastic health insurance), and we offer unlimited paid-time-off. We offer stock options to share in the success of the business. And of course, we have the typical startup on-site goodies like snacks, beer, and even a cold-brew coffee tap.\nModern technology with quality - We try to stay ahead of the technology curve, while being pragmatic about production readiness and community support. We care deeply about developer happiness, productivity, and experience .We are heavily investing in Elixir, an amazing functional language built on top of Erlang and the BEAM VM. We are also heavily investing in Typescript, a flexibly typed language that\'s fully interoperable with JavaScript.

We apply various testing strategies to ensure our code continues to meet functional requirements, and retains its high quality as it grows.\nDevelop your career - We take career development seriously.

We want our engineers to succeed and not only build great things at Blinker, but significantly grow their careers at the same time.\nHealthy, transparent, results-oriented workplace - We try to limit heavy-handed processes and overly prescriptive planning. We limit meetings, favoring ad-hoc and proactive communication. We care deeply about the team ""vibe"" and ensure we have an inclusive, fun, and engaging environment for everyone. We believe information is critical for our team to succeed, and we build tools to democratize data and support an open and honest environment. In our autonomous workplace, engineers make important decisions everyday and must feel they have the right amount of information to make those decisions - which is why we favor transparency.\nOpportunities to specialize and generalize - We don\'t have fixed teams at Blinker. Instead we spin up teams around a focused project, with clear goals and deliverable outputs. These teams give engineers the ability to dive deep on a given feature, or jump into a project where they have less technical or domain expertise.\n\nwNRmDhw7le'"

Our benefits package is great (including fantastic health insurance), and we offer unlimited paid-time-off. We offer stock options to share in the success of the business.

We care deeply about developer happiness, productivity, and experience .We are heavily investing in Elixir, an amazing functional language built on top of Erlang and the BEAM VM. We are also heavily investing in Typescript, a flexibly typed language that\'s fully interoperable with JavaScript.

We limit meetings, favoring ad-hoc and proactive communication. We care deeply about the team ""vibe"" and ensure we have an inclusive, fun, and engaging environment for everyone. We believe information is critical for our team to succeed, and we build tools to democratize data and support an open and honest environment. In our autonomous workplace, engineers make important decisions everyday and must feel they have the right amount of information to make those decisions - which is why we favor transparency.\nOpportunities to specialize and generalize - We don\'t have fixed teams at Blinker. Instead we spin up teams around a focused project, with clear goals and deliverable outputs. These teams give engineers the ability to dive deep on a given feature, or jump into a project where they have less technical or domain expertise.\n\nwNRmDhw7le'"
