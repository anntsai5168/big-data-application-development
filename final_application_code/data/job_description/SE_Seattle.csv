From our company's inception building the TASER device to a full suite of hardware and software solutions, we are focused on providing police agencies with the state-of-the-art devices and services they need to successfully serve and protect us. In the next few years, we're going to eliminate the burden of paperwork in policing, so officers can increase the time they spend building relationships and serving in their communities. We\xe2\x80\x99ll put video at the heart of the police record so our justice system can get to the truth faster.

And that\xe2\x80\x99s just the beginning. By building a data analytics platform to gather real-time insights from criminal data to help agencies solve crimes and keep patrol officers safe in the field, you will help transform the future of public safety.\n\nImagine the year 2030. Advanced technology has automated more and more routine tasks to put officers back in the community, dramatically improving the quality and safety of our lives. Artificial Intelligence connects the dots and surfaces insights to help prevent crime and keep officers and citizens informed and protected.\n\nSound exciting? We think so too.

From our company's inception building the TASER device to a full suite of hardware and software solutions, we are focused on providing police agencies with the state-of-the-art devices and services they need to successfully serve and protect us. In the next few years, we're going to eliminate the burden of paperwork in policing, so officers can increase the time they spend building relationships and serving in their communities.

And that\xe2\x80\x99s just the beginning. By building a data analytics platform to gather real-time insights from criminal data to help agencies solve crimes and keep patrol officers safe in the field, you will help transform the future of public safety.\n\nImagine the year 2030. Advanced technology has automated more and more routine tasks to put officers back in the community, dramatically improving the quality and safety of our lives. Artificial Intelligence connects the dots and surfaces insights to help prevent crime and keep officers and citizens informed and protected.\n\nSound exciting? We think so too.

From our company's inception building the TASER device to a full suite of hardware and software solutions, we are focused on providing police agencies with the state-of-the-art devices and services they need to successfully serve and protect us. In the next few years, we're going to eliminate the burden of paperwork in policing, so officers can increase the time they spend building relationships and serving in their communities.

By building a data analytics platform to gather real-time insights from criminal data to help agencies solve crimes and keep patrol officers safe in the field, you will help transform the future of public safety.\n\nImagine the year 2030. Advanced technology has automated more and more routine tasks to put officers back in the community, dramatically improving the quality and safety of our lives. Artificial Intelligence connects the dots and surfaces insights to help prevent crime and keep officers and citizens informed and protected.\n\nSound exciting? We think so too.
