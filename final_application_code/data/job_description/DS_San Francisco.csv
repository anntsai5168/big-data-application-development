To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups \xe2\x80\x94 women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nOur work in education is aimed at ensuring that every student \xe2\x80\x94 not just a lucky few \xe2\x80\x94 can get an education that\xe2\x80\x99s tailored to their individual needs and supports every aspect of their development. We\xe2\x80\x99re pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy, and advocacy work to help every young person enter adulthood with the skills and abilities they need to reach their full potential \xe2\x80\x94 and equip every teacher with the tools and research they need to help students get there. An example of the work CZI's education team supports include the Summit Learning Program, a personalized approach to teaching and learning that enhances the quality of student-teacher interactions and empowers educators to tailor instruction to individual student needs.\n\nOur Education Data Science team is responsible for measuring and evaluating product and program changes. For example, how product impacts student performance on cognitive skills, how schools onboard onto the program or how professional development impacts on onboarding, etc. This team defines measurements, product metrics, provides product insights through analysis, recommends what to improve and build next, as well as collaborates and communicates with the cross-functional and leadership teams.\n\nAs a Data Scientist with a Product focus, you will build metrics, visualizations, dashboards, provide data insight, product expertise, and a strategic perspective to partners throughout the organization. You will combine your deep knowledge of the product and user behavior with quantitative analysis to tell meaningful stories that inform team decisions. You will collaborate closely with your colleagues in Engineering, Product Management, User Experience Research and Product Design. You will understand the ins and outs of the product and database and you will be looked to as an expert across the team.\n\nYou will\n\nConduct data analysis to make product recommendations\nDeliver effective presentations of findings and recommendations to stakeholders, creating visual displays of quantitative information\nDevelop data visualizations, automate reports, iteratively build and prototype reusable dashboards to provide insights at scale\nCollaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to formulate and complete full cycle analysis that includes data gathering, analysis, ongoing scaled deliverables and presentations\nContribute to the data-driven decision-making across the team\n\nYou have\n\nQuantitative and data related work experience in product within the technology, finance, consulting or a related industry.\nExperience in metrics development, data exploration, solving problems using data, building product intuition, data visualization, and providing practical business insight using data.\nExperience with technologies such as SQL, R or Python.\nExcellent communication skills, with the ability to synthesize, simplify and explain complex problems to different types of audience with varied technical skills.\nPrior exposure to working cross-functionally with teams of product managers, engineers, designers, researchers, data scientists, and analysts."""
